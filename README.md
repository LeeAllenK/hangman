 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Vite <br/><br/>
  This is a game of hangman built with React. The UI design for this application is a darker theme. Users are greeted with a menu screen where they can choose the category they want to play.
  Once the game is started the user has multiply attempts to guess the word. Each category has a hint button attached to word to assist users with the answer. And with the use of 
  React's conditional rendering ensures each cateogory and hint stays seperate. Errors and visual words used React's useState() to update each item.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Optimizations:</h1>
  The app curently doesn't have a login for the users that will be one area of focus. I then will focus on a more mobile approach with React Native. 
  Users currently have 3 categories to choose from more to be added with future updates. There is currently no time limit a timer will be added with updates.

 A lesson learned was remembering state changes after each re-render. Since state updates utilizing conditional rendering is critical so users can see updated state.
