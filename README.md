 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite <br/><br/>
  This is a game of hangman built with React. The UI design for this application is a darker theme. Users are greeted with a menu screen where they can choose the category they want to play.
  Once the game is started the user has multiply attempts to guess the word. Each category has a hint button attached to word to assist users with the answer. And with the use of 
  React's conditional rendering ensures each cateogory and hint stays seperate. Errors and visual words used React's useState() to update each item.

Implement a login system to allow users to create accounts and save their preferences. Also develop a mobile version of the app using React Native. This will enable users to access the app on their mobile devices. Currently, users have three categories to choose from. Plan to add more categories in future updates to offer a wider range of options.

 One key lesson learned was the importance of remembering that state changes after each re-render. This ensures that the application remains responsive and up-to-date. Utilizing conditional rendering is critical for displaying updated state to users. This ensures that the UI reflects the current state of the application.
